# Railway Deployment Guide

## üö® **FOUND THE REAL CULPRIT: railway.json!**

**The problem**: There was a hidden `railway.json` file containing:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
  }
}
```

This file has **higher priority** than Procfile and railway.toml!

### **üîß IMMEDIATE FIX:**

#### **Option 1: Delete railway.json (Recommended)**
```bash
# Remove the problematic railway.json file
rm railway.json
git add .
git commit -m "Remove railway.json to use Procfile"
git push
```

#### **Option 2: Fixed railway.json (Current State)**
The `railway.json` is now fixed to:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python main.py"
  }
}
```

### **Railway Configuration Priority Order**
Railway checks files in this priority:
1. **`railway.json`** ‚Üê **This was overriding everything!**
2. `railway.toml`
3. `Procfile`
4. Auto-detection

### **Current Project Status**
- ‚úÖ `railway.json`: Fixed to use `python main.py`
- ‚úÖ `Procfile`: Contains `web: python main.py` 
- ‚úÖ `main.py`: Handles PORT environment variable correctly

## üéØ **Recommended Action**

**Delete railway.json for simplest setup:**
```bash
rm railway.json
```

Then push the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove railway.json config file"
git push
```

This ensures Railway uses only the Procfile, which is the standard approach.

## ‚úÖ **After This Fix**

Your deployment should work because:
1. No more conflicting configuration files
2. Railway will use Procfile: `web: python main.py`
3. `main.py` correctly handles `os.environ.get("PORT")`
4. No shell expansion issues!
